            <h3>Image optimization</h3>

            <p>Question 8: Compression means to minimize the size in bytes without making the quality lower than it should be. File size is important for space management.</p>
            <p>Question 9: We need to compress/optimize because if a slower PC accesses your web browser, they will take forever to download the image and probably never visit your site again.</p>
            <p>Question 10: GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, Paint.net</p>
